# Shortest Job First Scheduler

Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution.

This Repository Hosts Code that Implements the Preemptive Shortest Job First Algorithm in Multiple Programming Languages.

Switch to a Specific Branch Named after a programming language to find implementations in that programming language.
